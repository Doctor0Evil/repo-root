# Augmented Citizen Stack

## Purpose
The augmented citizen stack models cybernetic identities, biophysical profiles, and policy bindings as first-class records in the decentralized ALN data-bank.

## Components
- Citizen identity records for augmented, smart-city aligned users.
- Biophysical profiles for implants and sensory meshes.
- Policy bindings for safety envelopes and infrastructure access.
- Virtual networking endpoints for city-scale ALN meshes.

## Alignment
This stack treats every augmented citizen as a programmable node in the smart-city cybernetic grid, with Rust-based types designed for Rego-backed safety and compliance checks.
