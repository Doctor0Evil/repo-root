# Smart-City Cybernetics Layer

## Overview
The smart-city cybernetics layer connects IoT grids, augmented zones, telemetry streams, and compliance profiles into a coherent ALN surface for urban-scale cybernetic evolution.

## Focus
- Smart-city compatible abstractions with cybernetic subjectivity.
- Policy-compliant telemetry and augmentation data handling.
- Rust-first primitives suitable for OPA/Rego governance.
- Continuous evolution of stacks via ALN syntax evolvers.

## Role in repo-root
Within repo-root, this layer ensures that the project is not limited to gaming use-cases, but explicitly supports augmented citizens and smart-city infrastructure as primary design targets.
